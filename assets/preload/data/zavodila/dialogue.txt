:ruv:upset:true:It's k.
:ruv:upset:true:It's my job to handle this kind of stuff too anyway...

:ruv:You've pushed quite a lot of buttons while I was away, huh?

:ruv:But you decided to pull a struggle. So here we are.
:bf:happy:bop bop bee pa?!
:ruv:Name's Ruv by the way. But that is the last name you will probably be hearing after this.
:ruv:I would be too tired to do these kind of stuff, but...
:ruv:angry:...I have to do what I'm meant to do.
:ruv:upset:I'd say break a leg but I might end up breaking yours literally and I'm going to make this as painful as possible for you...
:ruv:upset:...and your little girlfriend.
